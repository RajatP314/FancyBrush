# FancyBrush
Javascript system for generating artwork

Brushes and paths are defined in a separate js file and loaded into the main html page via a '<script>' tag.
 
Brushes have methods for determining position, color, and size as functions of time (these must be defined for each brush you create)

You can specify an optional duration parameter in the brush constructor to specify how long the brush remains active, if it does not follow the main timer.

Better documentation coming soon.
